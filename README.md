## Project Overview üöÄ

This repository is a robust template for JavaScript development using **npm**. It comes equipped with tools for
formatting, spell-checking, a ready-to-use devcontainer, custom VS Code settings, essential repo files, automated
checks, integrated VS Code extensions, semantic releases, and extensive in-repo guides for project management and
customization.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Devcontainer & VS Code:** Ubuntu‚Äëbased Docker container with Node.js‚ÄØ20 and Python (for pre‚Äëcommit). Includes
  recommended VS‚ÄØCode extensions, workspace settings, and a seamless Codespaces experience.
- **Dependency Management:** npm for declarative `package.json` configuration and `package-lock.json` locking.
- **Formatting:** Prettier for JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, and YAML; enforced via pre-commit hooks and editor
  integrations.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Runs Prettier, yamllint, markdownlint, markdown-link-check, and other checks before commit.
- **Release Automation:** semantic-release on pushes to `main` to analyze commits, bump versions, generate changelogs,
  and publish GitHub releases automatically.
- **In-Repo Guides:** `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `STYLEGUIDE.md`, `SECURITY.md` to enforce best practices and streamline
  onboarding.

## Installation üì¶

Designed for **GitHub Codespaces**‚Äîrunning locally is untested and may require extra configuration.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

Most manual quality checks and workflows are exposed via `package.json` scripts. These commands mirror the editor
integrations, pre-commit hooks, and CI pipelines.

### Formatting & Spell Checking

```bash
npm run format              # check formatting
npm run format-fix          # apply formatting fixes
npm run spell               # run cspell
```
